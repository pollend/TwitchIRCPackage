# Events

Simple Twitch IRC for the most part is event based and takes heavy advantage of unity events. A more detailed description of the twitch API can be viewed here:(https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md). Most of the message groups provided by twitch are separated out into their own events handled by the wrapper.
