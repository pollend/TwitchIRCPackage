# Introduction

Simple Twitch IRC is a simple interface library used for interfacing between
twitch and Unity. The library is wrapped around a friendlier user interfaced,
focused component but the back end is also available for more fine tuning.
This includes sending custom messages to the server and a multi-threaded
handler for processing and sending messages.

This library is an extension on a mod written for Parkitect. This library
supports features as low as unity version 5.3.1 and uses features only available
in much older versions of C#. (http://parkitectnexus.com/assets/b46e768cfa/twitch-integration-alpha)
